This is sample code from lesson 6 on the old nehe.gamedev.net site.  It's not
building with WUT/gx2gl yet, but that'll change soon.  For now there are a few
minor changes I had to make to get this working on a modern PC:

* using fix-width integers for metadata fields in the bitmap
* changing int to GLuint in one place because modern gcc doesn't like implicit
  pointer casts as much as it apparently used to
* reduce angular velocity from 15 degrees per frame to 15 degrees per second
* silently fail when it can't load the image (not necessary for modern PCs but
  will make it easier to gradually port this to wii u).


Credits:
Jeff Molofee (nehe@home.com) for writing the tutorials.
Alfred (alfred@mazuma.net.au) for various fixes and improvements.
Lakmal Gunasekara (gunasekara@prostep.de) for a Solaris/SPARC
	and SGI/IRIX port, which has improved the portability
	of the code base.  Also for tutorial 8, which I only
	tweaked slightly (basically uncommented what had been
	commented out for Solaris).
Richard Campbell (ulmont@bellsouth.net) for GLUT/Linux port.
