This directory contains the pixel and vertex shader source code.  These are
compiled into bytecode by latte-assembler, which is a program you can find in
the tools subdirectory of the source for the decaf emulator at
https://github.com/decaf-emu/decaf-emu .

The bytecode is then embedded into C code using a simple tool I wrote which you
can find at https://github.com/snickerbockers/embed_c_code .  The code output
by that program is placed into glff_shader.h so it can be included into gx2gl at
compile-time.

Normally there's no reason to need to recompile the shaders, so glff_shader.h is
permanently checked into git and manually updated as needed.
